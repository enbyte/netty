A simple python library for networking to run chatrooms and small gameservers. Not extremely complex, but allows for simple game servers and chat rooms to be hosted.

# Documentation

`client-simple.py` and `server-simple.py` are provided for your perusal and enjoyment.  
### To test it out:
 - Run server-simple.py in a terminal tab.
 - Resolve the inevitable import conflicts.
 - Run one or more client-simple.py in different terminal tabs.
 - Move the blobs with arrow keys and test Ctrl-C to see how it handles KeyboardInterrupts.
